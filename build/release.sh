# A robust script to automate the release process.
#
# This script will:
# 1. Perform pre-flight checks (dependencies, git status).
# 2. Determine the version from cmd/version.go.
# 3. Generate a changelog since the last tag.
# 4. Optionally run in --dry-run mode.
# 5. Prompt for final confirmation, showing the changelog.
# 6. Create and push a git tag.
# 7. Run goreleaser to publish the release.
#
# It also includes two helper modes:
# --cleanup: Interactively deletes a release to recover from a failure.
# --dry-run: Runs all checks without making any changes.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
