### Multi-Agent Workflows (Deep Research)

`gllm` allows you to define and run complex workflows with multiple agents. This is useful for tasks like deep research, where you can have a planner agent, a dispatcher agent, and multiple worker agents to carry out sub-tasks.

- **List available workflows:**
  ```sh
  gllm workflow list
  ```

- **Start a workflow:**
  ```sh
  gllm workflow start "Research the latest advancements in AI."
  ```

Here's an example of a deep research workflow in action:

1.  **Planner:** Designs a plan for the research.
