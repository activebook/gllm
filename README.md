## üéØ Usage

### üîπ Basic Commands

```sh
gllm "What is Go?"               # Default model & system prompt
gllm "Summarize this" -a report.txt  # Use file as input
gllm "Translate into English" -a image1.jpg  # Use image as input and vision model
gllm "Where is the best place to visit in London?" -m @gpt4o # Switch model
gllm "How to find a process and terminate it?" -t @shellmate  # Use shellmate prompt to specific shell question
gllm -s "Who's the POTUS right now? and check what's his latest tariff policy" -m @gemini-pro -r 10 # Use Gemini model to search and set max references to 10
```

### üîç Search & Vision

```sh
gllm "Who is the President of the United States right now?" --search # Use search to find latest news
gllm "Who is he/she in this photo? And what is his/her current title?" -s -a "face.png" --model @gemini # Use vision model and search engine to find people in image
```

### üí¨ Keep Conversations (Multi-turn chat)

```sh
gllm -s "Who's the POTUS right now?" -c      # Start a conversation(default without name) and retain the full context (last 10 messages)
gllm "Tell me again, who's the POTUS right now?" -c   # Continue the default conversation
gllm "Let's talk about why we exist." -c newtalk      # Start a new named conversation called 'newtalk'
gllm -s "Look up what famous people have said about this." -c newtalk  # Continue the 'newtalk' conversation
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: If you're using **Gemini mode** and an **OpenAI-compatible model**, keep in mind that they **cannot be used within the same conversation**.  
These models handle chat messages differently, and mixing them will lead to unexpected behavior.

### üîπ Interactive Chat (*In Future Edition*)

```sh
gllm chat                         # Start chat with defaults
gllm chat -m gpt4o                # Start chat with a specific model
gllm chat --use-prompt coder      # Use a named system prompt
gllm chat --load my_session       # Load a saved chat session
```

### üîπ Prompt Templates

```sh
gllm --template @coder              # Use predefined coder prompt
gllm "Act as shell" --system-prompt "You are a Linux shell..."
gllm --system-prompt @shell-assistant --template @shellmate
```

### üîπ Configuration Management

gllm model default gpt4                   # Set default model
```

### üîπ Template & System Prompt Management
