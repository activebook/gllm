## Subtask 2 – Ecosystem, Integration & Business Value Assessment

| Objective | What to Investigate |
|---------------|------------------------|
| API & Tooling Landscape | • REST, gRPC, SDKs; language support; rate limits; pricing tiers. |
| Partner & Plugin Ecosystem | • Availability of third‑party extensions (data‑wrappers, analytics, fine‑tuning). <br>• Open‑source libraries vs proprietary services. |
| Community & Support | • Developer forums, documentation depth, sample projects, tutorials. <br>• Update cadence and backward compatibility. |
| Business Use‑Cases & ROI | • Case studies from enterprise chat, content generation, coding assistants, customer‑support bots. <br>• Cost‑benefit analysis (licensing vs open‑source + compute). |
| Interdisciplinary Applications | • Integration into research workflows (lab notebooks, data pipelines). <br>• Use in education, legal analysis, healthcare (clinical decision support). |
| Future‑Proofing & Vendor Lock‑in | • Portability of fine‑tuned models, open‑model export options. <br>• Forecasted feature roadmap and API stability. |
| Under‑represented Viewpoints | • Suitability for small enterprises, NGOs, and academic labs. <br>• Accessibility for developers in emerging markets (data‑budget, bandwidth constraints). |

**Expected Deliverable**: A comparative "Ecosystem Scorecard" that rates each platform on integration ease, community vitality, and business ROI, complete with qualitative insights and real‑world examples.
