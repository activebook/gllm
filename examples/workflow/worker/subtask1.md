## Subtask 1 – Technical & Benchmark-Driven Comparative Analysis

| Objective | What to Investigate |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Historical & Architectural Context | • Release dates, lineage (GPT‑4 → GPT‑5, Gemini‑2.0 → Gemini‑2.5, Grok‑1.x → Grok‑4). <br>• Core architectural differences (transformer depth, parameter count, sparsity, retrieval‑augmented design). |
| Current Capabilities & Performance | • In‑house benchmark scores (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) on FLORES, MMLU, HumanEval, Code‑Completion, etc. <br>• Speed & latency metrics (inference time, throughput). |
| Expert Opinions & Peer Review | • Summaries from leading AI labs, conference papers, and independent reviewers. <br>• Community sentiment from GitHub, Reddit, Stack Overflow. |
| Data‑Driven Insights | • Performance‑by‑task breakdown (NLP, coding, math, reasoning). <br>• Error‑type taxonomy and mitigation strategies. |
| Interdisciplinary Connections | • Adoption in scientific domains (biology, physics), creative arts (music, visual arts), and domain‑specific LLMs. |
| Future Implications | • Planned advances (e.g., multimodal, real‑time streaming, continual learning). <br>• Scalability & sustainability (energy consumption, carbon footprint). |
| Under‑represented Viewpoints | • Use‑cases in low‑resource languages and niche scientific subfields. <br>• Accessibility for developers with limited GPU/TPU resources. |

**Expected Deliverable**: A detailed, side‑by‑side matrix summarizing strengths/weaknesses across tasks, supplemented with a narrative that weighs the evidence and cites primary sources.
